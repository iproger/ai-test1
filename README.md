# CPU Simulator Dashboard

This is a minimal prototype of a browser-based CPU dashboard built with React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS and Recharts. The app simulates core load and temperature updates.

## Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `src/index.html` during development. The production build outputs `index.html` and the `assets` folder at the repository root for GitHub Pages.

Build for GitHub Pages:

```bash
npm run build
```
