# CPU Simulator Dashboard

A front-end CPU simulator built with React, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. It visualizes CPU load per thread and allows enqueuing simple tasks that run on a simulated CPU model. The dashboard now groups cores by cluster and includes a richer task creation form and settings panel.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build

The production build outputs files to the `dist/` directory. Deploy this folder
to GitHub Pages. Use `npm run dev` during development.

The Vite configuration sets `base: './'` so that compiled asset paths are
relative. This ensures they load correctly when the site is hosted on a GitHub
Pages subpath.
