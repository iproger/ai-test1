# CPU Simulator Dashboard

A front-end CPU simulator built with React, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. It visualizes CPU load per thread and allows enqueuing simple tasks that run on a simulated CPU model.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build

The production build outputs files directly in the project root so they can be
served via GitHub Pages. Use `npm run dev` during development, which temporarily
copies `index.dev.html` to `index.html` before starting the Vite server.
```
